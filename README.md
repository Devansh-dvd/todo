🚀 To-Do List Web App

A fully functional **To-Do List Website** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**!  
This project helped me explore core frontend concepts like dynamic task creation, custom deadlines, organizing tasks under different list names, and storing everything persistently using `localStorage`. 💾  

Seeing everything come together and work exactly as envisioned was an amazing experience! 🙌  

Next on the journey: **React.js** ⚛️ and **Bootstrap** 🎨 to build more dynamic and visually appealing apps.
